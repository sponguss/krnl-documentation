# Get Registry
```lua
<table> getreg()
```
Returns the Lua registry.

I dont yet know what this does, but by looking at it, it looks like a table full of functions, threads and more created by the Roblox environment, and by your exploit

Heres what i got by printing every value and index inside of the table
